is a pilot practice of alternative education. It promotes empirical and spontaneous exchanges and evokes for a new form of convergence. The project was initiated by Yang Wang and Zhenzhen Qi in 2015, in Brooklyn, New York. Discourse is a place for gathering, a space to play video games, fall asleep, and share breakfast. It nurtures the mundane interactive connectivity, investigates subtle integration of everyday conversational sphere, as well as encourages and traces improvised spoken verse. Discourse expands the forms of thought exchange instead of formal analytical and reactive argument.
